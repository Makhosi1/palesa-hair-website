            <h4><b><u>Moisturisers</b></h4></u>
            <p>Hair creams, moisturisers, lotions, milks, butters… whatever you call them, are all just lotion recipes
                optimised for your hair rather than your skin. The basic formula remains the same. In fact, you can use
                any
                one of my lotion recipes as a hair cream if you wish. The same principles of moisture, apply to both
                hair
                and skin!</p><br>

            <h5> How To Use Hair Moisturisers</h5>
            <p> There&apos;s no hard and fast rule when it comes to how you use your moisturiser - if it works, then
                it&apos;s right!
                One of the best things about making your own natural hair care products is that you don&apos;t need to
                worry
                about silicones, parabens & sulfates which can affect how and when you use your products! Here are a few
                ways you can use this all-natural hair cream:
                <li>As an everyday hair moisturiser</li>
                <li>As the cream or &quot;C&quot; in either the LOC or LCO method</li>
                <li>Apply as a sealant on your ends to limit split ends or breakage</li>
                <li>As an overnight treatment before washing your hair</li>
                <li> DIY leave-in spray: Dilute with some water and place in a spray bottle</li>

            </p>


            <p><i>Main ingredient: <li>water H<sub>2</sub>0</li></i>
                <li>Collodial Oatmeal</li>
            </p>

            <h4><b><u>Conditioners</b></h4></u><br>
            <h5>What is a conditioner.</h5>
            <p>To put it simply, after shampoo cleans and removes oils, conditioner reintroduces moisture back into your
                hair and helps to smooth your strands for a shiny, soft, healthy finish. It is kind of like how you wash
                your face and then apply moisturizer.</p><br>

            <h5>Types of hair conditioners</h5>
            <p> There are different types of conditioners that can be applied at different stages of your hair washing
                process but ultimately the main goal of all of them is to leave your hair shiny, sofy and healthy.


                <li> Deep conditioner - Deep conditioners are like the facials of the hair world. They take a little
                    extra time, but boy are they worth it! They&apos;re intensive, moisturising treatments intended to
                    penetrate deep into the hair shaft to moisturise, strengthen and improve the quality of your hair.
                </li>


                <li> Hair Mask - Hair masks are intensive conditioning hair treatments that moisturise, protect and
                    restore your hair. </li>

                <li> Rinse out conditioner - Rinse out conditioners “classic” or traditional conditioners that are
                    applied to wet hair after shampooing and rinsed out after a couple of minutes. They&apos;re fast
                    acting,
                    intensive treatments, designed to replenish your hair moisture levels, seals the cuticle and help
                    with detangling, strengthening and improving the look and feel of your hair!</li>

                <li> Leave-in conditioner - “Leave-in” conditioners are water-based conditioning treatments that are
                    designed to be left in your hair until you reach your next wash cycle. They&apos;re typically
                    applied to
                    damp hair after shampoo & any rinse-out treatments, but before you use styling or sealing products
                    such as hair gels, hair moisturisers, pomades, butters or hair grease. </li>
